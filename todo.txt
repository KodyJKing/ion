remove is and isnt and replace with === and !== explicit operators.
    because of possible confusion with ES7+ is/isnt operator proposals.
    also remove not, and, or operators and replace with !, &&, || for consistency.

need a base class object1

need merging syntactic sugar

a.b.c: 1
=>
a:
    b:
        c: 1

Need to fix array comprehensions to be lazily evaluated:
    let _ref = [];
    {
        let _ref2 = this.body;
        for (let _i = 0; _i < _ref2.length; _i++) {
            let s = _ref2[_i];
            _ref.push(this.context.createRuntime(s));
        }
    }
    this.statements = this.statements != null ? this.statements : _ref;

Optimize this: => if (!(this.statements != null))

Current temp variable creation is wrong, should use a counter on the root.
